      <h2>Key facts about Luca and the bread!</h2>
      <p>Luca commenced his career as a lifeguard but was laid off. He found he enjoyed making bread and experimented and in no time at all had built up a thriving business.</p>

      <h3>About Sourdough Bread</h3>
      <p>1. It has no store/commercial yeast</p>
      <p>2. Hand kneaded and shaped in-house</p>
      <p>3. Prepared over 14-17hrs</p>
      <p>4. Organic flour, the water is filtered and the electricity used to power the oven is solar powered!</p>
      <p>5. Store bought bread is mixed and baked within 2 hours meaning the gluten content is really high and can lead to someone feeling clogged up when eating bread. Sourdough is a great alternative and much easier to digest.</p>
